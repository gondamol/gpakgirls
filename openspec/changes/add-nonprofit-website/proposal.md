# Girl Pride Africa Kenya NGO Website

Girl Pride Africa Kenya needs a comprehensive digital presence to create awareness about teenage pregnancy and sexual abuse issues while attracting donor support.

  - Get Involved page with volunteer and partnership opportunities
  - Contact page with office location, contact details, and inquiry form
- **Donation system** with:

  - One-time and recurring donation options
  - Transparent breakdown of how donations are used
