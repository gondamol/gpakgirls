    story: 'After giving birth at 16, I thought my dreams of independence were over. My family was disappointed, and I felt lost. That\'s when I found GPAK Girls. They didn\'t judge me – instead, they saw my potential. The counseling helped me heal from the trauma and rebuild my confidence. Then came the tailoring program. For six months, I learned everything about dressmaking, pattern design, and running a business. The trainers were patient and encouraging. When I graduated, GPAK Girls gave me a sewing machine and helped me set up a small workspace at home. Now, two years later, I run my own tailoring business. I make school uniforms, dresses, and alterations for my community. I support my daughter and even hired an apprentice. My dream is to open a bigger shop and train other young mothers like GPAK Girls trained me.',

    story: 'When I got pregnant at 15, I had to drop out of Form 2. I was devastated because I loved school and wanted to become a nurse. After my baby was born, I felt hopeless. How could I go back to school with a child? A community health worker told me about GPAK Girls. They changed everything. First, the counselors helped me deal with the shame and depression I was feeling. Then they arranged childcare support and paid my school fees so I could return to school. A mentor from the program calls me every week to encourage me and help with my studies. She\'s a nurse herself, which inspires me so much. I\'m now in Form 4 preparing for my KCSE exams. My grades are good – I\'m even top of my class in biology! The tutoring program helped me catch up on what I missed. GPAK Girls believes in me when I stopped believing in myself. Next year, I\'ll apply to nursing school. My son will see his mother achieve her dreams.',

    story: 'I became pregnant at 17 after being abused by someone I trusted. I felt broken and worthless. My parents were supportive but poor – they couldn\'t afford to help me build a future. GPAK Girls found me through their outreach program. The counseling saved my life. I was able to talk about the abuse and start healing. They helped me report the case to authorities and supported me through that difficult process. Then they enrolled me in their hairdressing program. I discovered I had a real talent for it! I loved learning about different hairstyles, braiding techniques, and salon management. After completing the program, GPAK Girls helped me get a job at a local salon to gain experience. I saved every shilling. After one year, with a small loan from GPAK Girls, I opened my own small salon. Now I have three employees – all young mothers I\'m training! I also volunteer with GPAK Girls, talking to other survivors and showing them that recovery is possible. My son is now 3 years old and sees his mother as a businesswoman and community leader.',

    story: 'I got pregnant with my first child at 16, then again at 17. I felt like my life was over before it even started. With two babies and no education beyond Form 1, what future could I have? GPAK Girls reached out to me through a community program. They enrolled both my children in their childcare program and helped me complete my secondary education through adult learning classes. While studying, I also joined their mentorship program. My mentor was a teacher who encouraged me to consider education as a career. GPAK Girls then helped me get a position as a teacher\'s assistant at a local primary school. I work with young children and love it! I\'m now saving money to attend teacher training college. My children see me reading and studying, and they\'re learning to love education too. GPAK Girls taught me that being a young mother doesn\'t mean your dreams have to die. It just means you have more reasons to fight for them.',

    story: 'At 16, I became pregnant and was forced to marry the father. The marriage was difficult – there was no love, only obligation. After my daughter was born, I realized I needed to create a better life for both of us. I left the marriage and came to Nairobi with nothing. GPAK Girls took me in when I had nowhere to go. They provided emergency shelter and connected me with counselors who helped me process everything I\'d been through. I joined their tailoring program and discovered I had a gift for design. But I didn\'t want to just sew – I wanted to create fashion. GPAK Girls encouraged my ambition. After training, they helped me start a small business making African-print children\'s clothing. My designs became popular! I now sell online and at local markets. I\'ve been featured in a local magazine and I employ two other young mothers.
